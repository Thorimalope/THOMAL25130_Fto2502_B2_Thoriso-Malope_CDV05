          <h1>Hi, Im Thori</h1>

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Thoriso Malope, a passionate and adaptable front-end
            developer currently wrapping up my Software Development course at
            CodeSpace Academy. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Tailwind,
            JavaScript, and React, I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly
            web experiences. I'm currently open to junior developer roles,
            internships, and freelance opportunities, and I'm always eager to
            collaborate on meaningful projects that help me grow and make an
            impact. Lets build something great together!
          </p>

          <h1>Nice to meet you too...</h1>
          <p>
            Nice to meet you! I'm Thori, a newcomer to the tech space with a
            lifelong passion for building things—just ask my childhood Bob the
            Builder bed covers. In early 2025, I officially began my journey
            into Software Development at CodeSpace Academy, and I’ve been hooked
            ever since. From my first line of HTML to fetching data with React,
            each step has reinforced my love for front-end development. I’ve
            grown confident in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and I
            continue to sharpen those skills through hands-on projects that
            reflect real-world challenges. At CodeSpace, I completed a full-time
            program focused on web development fundamentals, modern JavaScript
            practices, and building responsive, dynamic web applications. I also
            worked on collaborative coding projects that helped me grow both
            technically and as a teammate. Whether it's crafting a clean UI,
            creating interactive DOM elements, or integrating APIs, I approach
            each challenge with curiosity and determination. I’m constantly
            learning, experimenting, and building. I'm currently looking for
            intern or junior developer opportunities where I can contribute,
            grow, and continue transforming into the developer I aspire to be.
            Want to see what I’ve built so far? Check out the projects below.

          <p>
            A simple, interactive Kanban board web app built with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. It allows users to create, view, edit and delete tasks
            across three columns: TODO, DOING, and DONE. Tasks are saved in
            localStorage, so they persist across page reloads. Users can also
            switch between a light and dark these as well as show and hide the
            sidebar as they wish with theme toggle and create task functions
            still available for mobile users
